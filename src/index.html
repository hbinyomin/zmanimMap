                <p>
                    There is a well-known halacha that one should face Yerushalayim when davening. This presents an
                    interesting question when one is a great distance away from Yerushalayim, as will be explained.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although it is simple to plot out a straight path from point A to point B on a flat map, plotting
                    out a "straight path" from point A to point B along the earth's roughly-spherical shape is not a
                    simple matter. A full explanation is beyond the scope of these notes, but a very brief
                    explanation follows here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general there are two different "direct" ways to get from point A to point B on the curved globe.
                    The first way is to travel along a path that maintains a constant compass bearing the entire
                    journey. However, compass direction is always relative to earth's north pole, so consider the
                    following. If one begins a journey heading out at, let's say 45° (north-east), and continues to
                    travel perfectly straight, his orientation to-, and angle relative to the north pole will constantly
                    be shifting and thus his compass direction will likewise constantly shift. In order to maintain a
                    constant compass direction while traveling from point A to B, one needs to travel on a slightly
                    curved path that will maintain a constant angle between the path and the north pole. This curved
                    path is known as a "rhumb line." One of the most common map projections – which transposes points on
                    the earth's curved surface to a flat map - is known as a Mercator projection. The Mercator
                    projection is based on the same mathematics as a that of a rhumb line, and a [curved] rhumb line
                    path along the earth will appear as a straight line on a Mercator projection. Let's take an example:
                    looking at a standard Mercator projection map we see that a straight line heading out of New York at
                    96° (slightly south-east) connects to Yerushalayim. Thus, if one heads out of NY at 96° and, using
                    his compass, constantly veers to maintain a constant compass direction, he will end up in
                    Yerushalayim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second direct way to get from point A to B is to leave from point A initially heading in a
                    direction such that continuing to travel on a straight path without any veering will bring
                    one to point B. Any path that fits this description is known as a "great circle route." On a
                    standard flat map, a great circle route between points A and B appears to be curved, and
                    significantly so when A and B are a great distance apart. Nevertheless, since this is in fact a
                    straight path along the earth's roughly-spherical shape with no veering the entire route, it is the
                    shortest path between points A and B. Airlines commonly use these routes to conserve time and fuel.
                    However, as one travels along this straight route, his compass-bearing will constantly be changing.
                    Using our above example of New York to Yerushalayim, if one heads out of New York with an initial
                    compass-direction of 54° (slightly east of north-east) and maintains a straight path, he will arrive
                    in
                    Yerushalayim. See this link for a very interesting interactive model of <a target="blank"
                        href="https://www.greatcirclemap.com/globe?routes=LGA-TLV%2C%20LAX-TLV&unit=nm">
                        great circle routes.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our example above of New York to Yerushalayim, there is a significant difference between the
                    rhumb line route (maintaining a compass direction of 96°) and the great circle route (heading out
                    with an initial compass direction of 54° and maintaining a straight path). However, when points A
                    and B are relatively close to each other, there is little difference between the great circle route
                    and the rhumb line route. You can verify this fact on this site by placing map markers relatively
                    close to Yerushalayim and comparing the respective differences between the rhumb line and great
                    circle directions to Yerushalayim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When determining how to position oneself to face Yerushalayim when davening, which one of the above
                    methods should he use? This is a subject of dispute amongst the Poskim and one should consult a rav
                    regarding which view to follow. It should be noted that there may be other factors that would
                    override the preference of facing Yerushalayim and one should consult a rav regarding how to conduct
                    himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each location, this site presents both the constant compass bearing of the rhumb line route, as
                    well as the initial compass bearing of the great circle route to Yerushalayim. The above is
                    displayed both in a numeric measurement of degrees and in a visual representation of a compass
                    pointing to the given degrees. For the degree measurements use the following key: 0° = north, 90° =
                    east, 180° = south, and 270° = west. For the compass representation: up is north (0°), right is east
                    (90°), down is south (180°), and left is west (270°).

                <p>Locations at Earth's extreme north or south experience times of the year when the sun doesn't fully
                    or even partially rise or set. The zmanim for such locations may display an error ("NaN"), and even
                    if an
                    error is not displayed, the zmanim may not be valid. This situation presents a unique
                    halachic question, and one who plans to be in such a location should consult a Rav regarding how to
                    proceed.
